# minizip

This is a short project to implement Huffman Coding to understand how file compression works. `zip` seems to use a similar kind of compression but does it at a level higher than character level.

Note for self - what happens to compression levels when you combine Huffman with bytecode pairing?

This is a part of a bunch of miniX projects I have done where I re-implement a simple version of something to understand how it works. A full list of all these projects can be found here -
